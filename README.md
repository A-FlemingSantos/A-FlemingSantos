Hello, GitHub community! My name is Arthur Fleming, I'm 16 years old, and currently in my second year of high school. I recently joined GitHub and I'm excited to contribute to open-source projects and share my own.

### 🌱 What I'm Working On
I'm developing a project with my TCC (final coursework) team of five members. We're creating a Web and Mobile application using HTML, CSS, React, Java, and SQL to help students organize their studies and collaborate on projects. We're still working on a good name for it!

### 📚 What I'm Learning
I'm currently focusing on Python and SQL as I pursue a career in Data Science and AI. Additionally, I study HTML, CSS, and React, but my primary focus is on Python and SQL. In the future, I plan to learn C#, Kotlin, PowerShell, and more.

### 🔍 What I'm Looking for on GitHub
I want to contribute to open-source projects related to UI development, data, and AI. I’m also interested in improving project documentation in different languages, such as Python. Additionally, I’d love to connect with other students, whether beginners or experienced programmers, and join study groups.

### 📩 How to Reach Me
I don't have many contact platforms yet, but I plan to share my work on X, Reddit, and LinkedIn in the future.

Thanks for reading! I'm always open to conversations and collaboration on open-source projects.

See you around! 🚀
